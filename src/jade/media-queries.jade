        h2 Overview
        p
          | GroundworkCSS has been built to help you make websites that look great on any screen, big ones, small ones, and ones in sizes that have yet to be invented. GroundworkCSS columns, by default, expand to full-width rows when the viewport drops below 768 pixels.
        h2 Mobile and Tablet Layouts
        p
          | In cases where you want columns for smaller widths, you simply add one of these classes:
        dl
          dt
            code small-tablet
          dd Grid structure remains intact until 480 pixel viewport widths
          dt
            code mobile
          dd Grid structure remains intact at all sizes.
        h6 Example usage:
        script(src='https://gist.github.com/ghepting/5282687.js')
        noscript
          p.error.callout Javascript is required to display Gist from Github
        h6 Result:
